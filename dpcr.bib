	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0015244},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The putative promoter of the holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) gene on chromosome 21 is hypermethylated in placental tissues and could be detected as a fetal-specific DNA marker in maternal plasma. Detection of fetal trisomy 21 (T21) has been demonstrated by an epigenetic-genetic chromosome dosage approach where the amount of hypermethylated HLCS in maternal plasma is normalized using a fetal genetic marker on the Y chromosome as a chromosome dosage reference marker. We explore if this method can be applied on both male and female fetuses with the use of a paternally-inherited fetal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele on a reference chromosome for chromosome dosage normalization.
METHODOLOGY: We quantified hypermethylated HLCS molecules using methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion followed by real-time or digital PCR analyses. For chromosome dosage analysis, we compared the amount of digestion-resistant HLCS to that of a SNP allele (rs6636, a C/G SNP) that the fetus has inherited from the father but absent in the pregnant mother.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a fetal-specific SNP allele on a reference chromosome, we analyzed 20 euploid and nine T21 placental tissue samples. All samples with the fetal-specific C allele were correctly classified. One sample from each of the euploid and T21 groups were misclassified when the fetal-specific G allele was used as the reference marker. We then analyzed 33 euploid and 14 T21 maternal plasma samples. All but one sample from each of the euploid and T21 groups were correctly classified using the fetal-specific C allele, while correct classification was achieved for all samples using the fetal-specific G allele as the reference marker.
CONCLUSIONS: As a proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated that the epigenetic-genetic chromosome dosage approach can be applied to the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 for both male and female fetuses.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in nanofluidic technologies have enabled the use of Integrated Fluidic Circuits (IFCs) for high-throughput Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping (GT). In this study, we implemented and validated a relatively low cost nanofluidic system for SNP-GT with and without Specific Target Amplification (STA). As proof of principle, we first validated the effect of input DNA copy number on genotype call rate using well characterised, digital PCR (dPCR) quantified human genomic DNA samples and then implemented the validated method to genotype 45 SNPs in the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, nuclear genome. When STA was not incorporated, for a homozygous human DNA sample, reaction chambers containing, on average 9 to 97 copies, showed 100\% call rate and accuracy. Below 9 copies, the call rate decreased, and at one copy it was 40\%. For a heterozygous human DNA sample, the call rate decreased from 100\% to 21\% when predicted copies per reaction chamber decreased from 38 copies to one copy. The tightness of genotype clusters on a scatter plot also decreased. In contrast, when the same samples were subjected to STA prior to genotyping a call rate and a call accuracy of 100\% were achieved. Our results demonstrate that low input DNA copy number affects the quality of data generated, in particular for a heterozygous sample. Similar to human genomic DNA, a call rate and a call accuracy of 100\% was achieved with whale genomic DNA samples following multiplex STA using either 15 or 45 SNP-GT assays. These calls were 100\% concordant with their true genotypes determined by an independent method, suggesting that the nanofluidic system is a reliable platform for executing call rates with high accuracy and concordance in genomic sequences derived from biological tissue.},

	abstract = {The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as erbB2) gene is involved in signal transduction for cell growth and differentiation. It is a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase and a proto-oncogene. Overexpression of HER2 is of clinical relevance in breast cancer due to its prognostic value correlating elevated expression with worsening clinical outcome. At the same time, HER2 assessment is also of importance because successful anti-tumor treatment with Herceptin® is strongly correlated with HER2 overexpression in the tumor (approximately 30\% of all breast tumors overexpress HER2). In a comprehensive national study, Wolff et al. [1] state that "Approximately 20\% of current HER2 testing may be inaccurate" which underscores the importance of developing more accurate methods to determine HER2 status. Droplet Digital™ PCR (ddPCR™) has the potential to improve upon HER2 measurements due to its ability to quantitate DNA and RNA targets with high precision and accuracy. Here we present a study which investigates whether ddPCR can be used to assess HER2 transcript levels in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) human breast tumors and whether these ddPCR measurements agree with prior assessments of these same samples by pathologists using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in some cases fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We also determined the copy number of HER2 in these samples as compared to the CEP17 reference gene. Results: Clinical FFPE samples were successfully studied using ddPCR and compared to results from standard FISH and IHC methodology. The results demonstrate that ddPCR can rank order the samples in complete agreement with the current standard methods and that ddPCR has the added benefit of providing quantitative results, rather than relying on the expert skill of a seasoned pathologist for determination.},

The evaluation of gene copy numbers by a qPCR method, is one of the most common approaches used to assess the consistency of transgenes in a constructed cell line.

AV529-19 is used to support the replication of a defective HSV-2 viral candidate vaccine called HSV529. To assess the genetic stability of the UL5 and UL29 transgenes in AV529-19 cells, a digital PCR-based approach was developed. During characterization of the test method, the specificity, accuracy, and intermediate precision of the assay was investigated based on regulatory guidelines. The developed assay was used to monitor the stability of the transgenes in the manufactured AV529-19 cell lines by comparison of transgene copy numbers in the master cell bank (MCB) with their copy numbers in the extended cell bank (ECB). Results showed that the UL29 and UL5 transgenes are stable in that there are one and three copies of the UL29 and UL5 genes, respectively, per cell in both the AV529-19 MCB and ECB.},

	doi = {10.1373/clinchem.2009.134114},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of fetal DNA in maternal plasma for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 (T21) is an actively researched area. We propose a novel method of T21 detection that combines fetal-specific epigenetic and genetic markers.
METHODS: We used combined bisulfite restriction analysis to search for fetal DNA markers on chromosome 21 that were differentially methylated in the placenta and maternal blood cells and confirmed any target locus with bisulfite sequencing. We then used methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion followed by microfluidics digital PCR analysis to investigate the identified marker. Chromosome-dosage analysis was performed by comparing the dosage of this epigenetic marker with that of the ZFY (zinc finger protein, Y-linked) gene on chromosome Y.
RESULTS: The putative promoter of the HLCS (holocarboxylase synthetase) gene was hypermethylated in the placenta and hypomethylated in maternal blood cells. A chromosome-dosage comparison of the hypermethylated HLCS and ZFY loci could distinguish samples of T21 and euploid placental DNA. Twenty-four maternal plasma samples from euploid pregnancies and 5 maternal plasma samples from T21 pregnancies were analyzed. All but 1 of the euploid samples were correctly classified.
CONCLUSIONS: The epigenetic-genetic chromosome-dosage approach is a new method for noninvasive prenatal detection of T21. The epigenetic part of the analysis can be applied to all pregnancies. Because the genetic part of the analysis uses paternally inherited, fetal-specific genetic markers that are abundant in the genome, broad population coverage should be readily achievable. This approach has the potential to become a generally usable technique for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis.},

We use this technique in our healthy study population to determine the overall concentration of the t(14;18) translocation, which is strongly associated with follicular lymphoma. The nested dPCR approach improves the detection limit to 1×10(-7) or lower while maintaining the analysis efficiency and specificity. Further, the bead-based dPCR enabled us to isolate and quantify the relative amounts of the various clonal forms of t(14;18) translocation in these subjects, and the single-molecule sensitivity and resolution of dPCR led to the discovery of new clonal forms of t(14;18) that were otherwise masked by the conventional quantitative PCR measurements. In this manner, we created a quantitative map for this carcinogenic mutation in this healthy population and identified the positions on chromosomes 14 and 18 where the vast majority of these t(14;18) events occur.},

While many studies characterise dPCR capabilities for DNA quantification, less work has been performed investigating similar parameters using RT-dPCR for RNA analysis. RT-dPCR measurement using three, one-step RT-qPCR kits was evaluated using single and multiplex formats when measuring endogenous and synthetic RNAs. The best performing kit was compared to UV quantification and sensitivity and technical reproducibility investigated. Our results demonstrate assay and kit dependent RT-dPCR measurements differed significantly compared to UV quantification. Different values were reported by different kits for each target, despite evaluation of identical samples using the same instrument. RT-dPCR did not display the strong inter-assay agreement previously described when analysing DNA. This study demonstrates that, as with DNA measurement, RT-dPCR is capable of accurate quantification of low copy RNA targets, but the results are both kit and target dependent supporting the need for calibration controls.},

	abstract = {Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) provides the most sensitive measurement of residual infection in patients on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has recently been shown to provide highly accurate quantification of DNA copy number, but its application to quantification of HIV DNA, or other equally rare targets, has not been reported. This paper demonstrates and analyzes the application of ddPCR to measure the frequency of total HIV DNA (pol copies per million cells), and episomal 2-LTR (long terminal repeat) circles in cells isolated from infected patients. Analysis of over 300 clinical samples, including over 150 clinical samples assayed in triplicate by ddPCR and by real-time PCR (qPCR), demonstrates a significant increase in precision, with an average 5-fold decrease in the coefficient of variation of pol copy numbers and a {\textgreater}20-fold accuracy improvement for 2-LTR circles. Additional benefits of the ddPCR assay over qPCR include absolute quantification without reliance on an external standard and relative insensitivity to mismatches in primer and probe sequences. These features make digital PCR an attractive alternative for measurement of HIV DNA in clinical specimens. The improved sensitivity and precision of measurement of these rare events should facilitate measurements to characterize the latent HIV reservoir and interventions to eradicate it.},

	issn = {1530-8561},
	doi = {10.1373/clinchem.2009.132951},
	abstract = {AIM: A digital PCR approach has recently been suggested to detect greater amounts of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma than conventional real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Because the digital qPCR approach uses shorter PCR amplicons than the real-time qPCR assay, we investigated whether a real-time qPCR assay appropriately modified for such short amplicons would improve the detection of cell-free fetal DNA.
METHOD: We developed a novel universal-template (UT) real-time qPCR assay that was specific for the DYS14 sequence on Y chromosome and had a short amplicon size of 50 bp. We examined this "short" assay with 50 maternal plasma samples and compared the results with those for a conventional real-time qPCR assay of the same locus but with a longer amplicon (84 bp).
RESULTS: Qualitatively, both assays detected male cell-free fetal DNA with the same specificity and detection capability. Quantitatively, however, the new UT real-time qPCR assay for shorter amplicons detected, on average, almost 1.6-fold more cell-free fetal DNA than the conventional real-time qPCR assay with longer amplicons.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of short PCR amplicons improves the detection of cell-free fetal DNA. This feature may prove useful in attempts to detect cell-free fetal DNA under conditions in which the amount of template is low, such as in samples obtained early in pregnancy.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a SlipChip to perform digital PCR in a very simple and inexpensive format. The fluidic path for introducing the sample combined with the PCR mixture was formed using elongated wells in the two plates of the SlipChip designed to overlap during sample loading. This fluidic path was broken up by simple slipping of the two plates that removed the overlap among wells and brought each well in contact with a reservoir preloaded with oil to generate 1280 reaction compartments (2.6 nL each) simultaneously. After thermal cycling, end-point fluorescence intensity was used to detect the presence of nucleic acid. Digital PCR on the SlipChip was tested quantitatively by using Staphylococcus aureus genomic DNA. As the concentration of the template DNA in the reaction mixture was diluted, the fraction of positive wells decreased as expected from the statistical analysis. No cross-contamination was observed during the experiments. At the extremes of the dynamic range of digital PCR the standard confidence interval determined using a normal approximation of the binomial distribution is not satisfactory. Therefore, statistical analysis based on the score method was used to establish these confidence intervals. The SlipChip provides a simple strategy to count nucleic acids by using PCR. It may find applications in research applications such as single cell analysis, prenatal diagnostics, and point-of-care diagnostics. SlipChip would become valuable for diagnostics, including applications in resource-limited areas after integration with isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies and visual readout.},

	abstract = {Brain metastases are associated with high morbidity as well as with poor prognosis and survival in breast cancer patients. Despite its clinical importance, metastasis of breast cancer cells through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is poorly understood. The objective of our study was to investigate whether cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play crucial roles in breast cancer brain metastasis. Using a cell adhesion assays, in vitro BBB permeability and transmigration assays, and soft agar colony formation assays, we investigated the physical roles of CAFs in breast cancer brain metastasis. We also performed immunofluorescence, flow cytometric analysis, Droplet Digital PCR, and Simon(TM) Simple Western System to confirm changes in expression levels. We established two novel three-dimensional (3-D) culture systems using a perpendicular slide chamber and applying 3-D embedded culture method to reflect brain metastasis conditions. With a newly developed device, CAFs was proven to promote cell adhesion to human brain microvascular endothelial cells, in vitro BBB permeability and transmigration, and colony formation of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, CAFs enhanced the invasive migration of breast cancer cells in two kinds of 3-D cultures. These 3-D models also reliably recapitulate the initial steps of BBB transmigration, micro-metastasis, and colonization. Expression of integrin α5β1 and αvβ3, c-MET, and α2,6-siayltransferase was increased in breast cancer cells that migrated through the BBB. In conclusion, based on our in vitro BBB and co-culture models, our data suggest that CAFs may play a role in breast cancer brain metastasis. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Three thousand and sixty PCR reactions were performed for each of the target chromosomes (X, Y, 13, 18, and 21), and the number of single molecule amplifications was compared to a reference. The difference between target and reference chromosome counts was used to determine the ploidy of each of the target chromosomes.
RESULTS: Digital PCR accurately identified all cases of fetal trisomy (3 cases of trisomy 21, 3 cases of trisomy 18, and 2 cases of triosmy 13) in the 40 specimens analyzed. The remaining specimens were determined to have normal ploidy for the chromosomes tested.
CONCLUSION: Microfluidic digital PCR allows detection of fetal chromosomal aneuploidy utilizing uncultured amniocytes and chorionic villus tissue in less than 6 hours.},

	abstract = {Most cancer genomes are characterized by the gain or loss of copies of some sequences through deletion, amplification or unbalanced translocations. Delineating and quantifying these changes is important in understanding the initiation and progression of cancer, in identifying novel therapeutic targets, and in the diagnosis and prognosis of individual patients. Conventional methods for measuring copy-number are limited in their ability to analyse large numbers of loci, in their dynamic range and accuracy, or in their ability to analyse small or degraded samples. This latter limitation makes it difficult to access the wealth of fixed, archived material present in clinical collections, and also impairs our ability to analyse small numbers of selected cells from biopsies. Molecular copy-number counting (MCC), a digital PCR technique, has been used to delineate a non-reciprocal translocation using good quality DNA from a renal carcinoma cell line. We now demonstrate microMCC, an adaptation of MCC which allows the precise assessment of copy number variation over a significant dynamic range, in template DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical biopsies. Further, microMCC can accurately measure copy number variation at multiple loci, even when applied to picogram quantities of grossly degraded DNA extracted after laser capture microdissection of fixed specimens. Finally, we demonstrate the power of microMCC to precisely interrogate cancer genomes, in a way not currently feasible with other methodologies, by defining the position of a junction between an amplified and non-amplified genomic segment in a bronchial carcinoma. This has tremendous potential for the exploitation of archived resources for high-resolution targeted cancer genomics and in the future for interrogating multiple loci in cancer diagnostics or prognostics.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: : To distinguish the cis-trans relationship of two sequence changes and to arrive at an accurate molecular diagnosis for autosomal recessive disorders, methods such as Sanger sequencing cannot differentiate whether sequence changes are in cis or trans. In addition, most techniques theoretically appropriate for allelic discrimination depend on the specific identified sequence changes for assay design, need extensive optimization, or may not be suitable. We developed a method that does not fully depend on the specific nucleotide changes. It enables efficient assay design and practical implementation of allelic discrimination.
METHODS: : Digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to separate and amplify alleles. Sanger sequencing was subsequently used to identify sequence changes.
RESULTS: : We developed a cost-effective digital PCR method for allelic discrimination of short amplicons and demonstrated it with p.Val27Ile and p.Glu114Gly in GJB2 as an example. We also successfully developed a long-range digital PCR approach to determine the cis-trans relationship of p.Arg117His and 5T in the CFTR gene.
CONCLUSION: : Digital PCR for allelic discrimination can be clinically implemented to determine the allelic configuration of relatively common sequence changes which frequently appear together and have clinical ramifications, such as the combination of p.Val27Ile and p.Glu114Gly in the GJB2 gene and p.Arg117His and 5T in CFTR.},

	volume = {59},
	issn = {1530-8561},
	doi = {10.1373/clinchem.2013.206359},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiplex digital PCR (dPCR) enables noninvasive and sensitive detection of circulating tumor DNA with performance unachievable by current molecular-detection approaches. Furthermore, picodroplet dPCR facilitates simultaneous screening for multiple mutations from the same sample.
METHODS: We investigated the utility of multiplex dPCR to screen for the 7 most common mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) oncogene from plasma samples of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Fifty plasma samples were tested from patients for whom the primary tumor biopsy tissue DNA had been characterized by quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Tumor characterization revealed that 19 patient tumors had KRAS mutations. Multiplex dPCR analysis of the plasma DNA prepared from these samples identified 14 samples that matched the mutation identified in the tumor, 1 sample contained a different KRAS mutation, and 4 samples had no detectable mutation. Among the tumor samples that were wild type for KRAS, 2 KRAS mutations were identified in the corresponding plasma samples. Duplex dPCR (i.e., wild-type and single-mutation assay) was also used to analyze plasma samples from patients with KRAS-mutated tumors and 5 samples expected to contain the BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) V600E mutation. The results for the duplex analysis matched those for the multiplex analysis for KRAS-mutated samples and, owing to its higher sensitivity, enabled detection of 2 additional samples with low levels of KRAS-mutated DNA. All 5 samples with BRAF mutations were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the clinical utility of multiplex dPCR to screen for multiple mutations simultaneously with a sensitivity sufficient to detect mutations in circulating DNA obtained by noninvasive blood collection.},

We find that insulin is strongly expressed in GABAergic neurogliaform cells in the cerebral cortex of the rat detected by single-cell digital PCR. Focal application of glucose or glibenclamide to neurogliaform cells mimics the excitation suppressing effect of external insulin on local microcircuits via insulin receptors. Thus, neurogliaform cells might link GABAergic and insulinergic action in cortical microcircuits.},

	doi = {10.1186/1476-4598-5-36},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common hereditary neurocutaneous disorder and it is associated with an elevated risk for malignant tumors of tissues derived from neural crest cells. The NF1 gene is considered a tumor suppressor gene and inactivation of both copies can be found in NF1-associated benign and malignant tumors. Melanocytes also derive from neural crest cells but melanoma incidence is not markedly elevated in NF1. In this study we could analyze a typical superficial spreading melanoma of a 15-year-old boy with NF1 for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within the NF1 gene. Neurofibromatosis in this patient was transmitted by the boy's farther who carried the mutation NF1 c. 5546 G/A.
RESULTS: Melanoma cells were isolated from formalin-fixed tissue by liquid coverslip laser microdissection. In order to obtain statistically significant LOH data, digital PCR was performed at the intragenic microsatellite IVS27AC28 with DNA of approx. 3500 melanoma cells. Digital PCR detected 23 paternal alleles and one maternal allele. Statistical analysis by SPRT confirmed significance of the maternal allele loss.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first molecular evidence of inactivation of both copies of the NF1 gene in a typical superficial spreading melanoma of a patient with NF1. The classical double-hit inactivation of the NF1 gene suggests that the NF1 genetic background promoted melanoma genesis in this patient.},

We developed a simple strategy for mitigating these complications, allowing truly digital RNA-Seq. Following reverse transcription, a large set of barcode sequences is added in excess, and nearly every cDNA molecule is uniquely labeled by random attachment of barcode sequences to both ends. After PCR, we applied paired-end deep sequencing to read the two barcodes and cDNA sequences. Rather than counting the number of reads, RNA abundance is measured based on the number of unique barcode sequences observed for a given cDNA sequence. We optimized the barcodes to be unambiguously identifiable, even in the presence of multiple sequencing errors. This method allows counting with single-copy resolution despite sequence-dependent bias and PCR-amplification noise, and is analogous to digital PCR but amendable to quantifying a whole transcriptome. We demonstrated transcriptome profiling of Escherichia coli with more accurate and reproducible quantification than conventional RNA-Seq.},

Random and independent distribution of target DNA molecules throughout partitions, which is critical to accurate digital PCR measurement, was demonstrated by spatial distribution analysis. The estimated relative uncertainty for target DNA concentration was under 6\% when analyzing five digital panels comprising 765 partitions each, provided the panels contained an average of 212 to 3,365 template molecules.

	abstract = {Comprehensive profiling of nucleic acids in genetically heterogeneous samples is important for clinical and basic research applications. Universal digital high-resolution melt (U-dHRM) is a new approach to broad-based PCR diagnostics and profiling technologies that can overcome issues of poor sensitivity due to contaminating nucleic acids and poor specificity due to primer or probe hybridization inaccuracies for single nucleotide variations. The U-dHRM approach uses broad-based primers or ligated adapter sequences to universally amplify all nucleic acid molecules in a heterogeneous sample, which have been partitioned, as in digital PCR. Extensive assay optimization enables direct sequence identification by algorithm-based matching of melt curve shape and Tm to a database of known sequence-specific melt curves. We show that single-molecule detection and single nucleotide sensitivity is possible. The feasibility and utility of U-dHRM is demonstrated through detection of bacteria associated with polymicrobial blood infection and microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with host response to infection. U-dHRM using broad-based 16S rRNA gene primers demonstrates universal single cell detection of bacterial pathogens, even in the presence of larger amounts of contaminating bacteria; U-dHRM using universally adapted Lethal-7 miRNAs in a heterogeneous mixture showcases the single copy sensitivity and single nucleotide specificity of this approach.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) latently infects a majority of adults. In about 1\% of the population HHV-6 exists in a chromosomally integrated form (ciHHV-6) that resides in every somatic and germ cell and can be transmitted through the germ line. Patients with ciHHV-6 have been misdiagnosed and unnecessarily treated for active HHV-6 infection, sometimes with important side effects, based on results from quantitative molecular HHV-6 tests.METHODS: A droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay was developed to identify ciHHV-6 in cellular patient samples by precisely determining the ratio of HHV-6 to cellular DNA. We validated the assay on confirmed ciHHV-6 patient samples and a cell line derived from a ciHHV-6 patient, and we analyzed hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients suspected of having ciHHV-6. We additionally evaluated whether the assay could be applied to stored plasma samples from a study of clinical correlates of HHV-6.RESULTS: The ddPCR assay accurately identified ciHHV-6 in cellular samples (buffy coat, peripheral blood mononuclear cells), giving a ratio very close to 1 HHV-6/cell [mean (SD), 1.02 (0.03)] in fluorescence in situ hybridization-confirmed samples). In stored plasma samples, the assay performance was set by design to have 100\% sensitivity, which resulted in 82\% specificity for ciHHV-6.CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of ciHHV-6 is often overlooked in patients with detectable HHV-6 viral loads by quantitative PCR. Our ddPCR test provides rapid and accurate laboratory identification of ciHHV-6 from easily obtained cellular samples. In addition, the assay provides excellent sensitivity and specificity using stored plasma samples, facilitating retrospective analysis of the clinical significance of ciHHV-6.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Tumor genotyping using cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA) has the potential to allow noninvasive assessment of tumor biology, yet many existing assays are cumbersome and vulnerable to false-positive results. We sought to determine whether droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) of cfDNA would allow highly specific and quantitative assessment of tumor genotype.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ddPCR assays for EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF mutations were developed using plasma collected from patients with advanced lung cancer or melanoma of a known tumor genotype. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using cancers with nonoverlapping genotypes as positive and negative controls. Serial assessment of response and resistance was studied in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer on a prospective trial of erlotinib.
RESULTS: We identified a reference range for EGFR L858R and exon 19 deletions in specimens from KRAS-mutant lung cancer, allowing identification of candidate thresholds with high sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Received operative characteristic curve analysis of four assays demonstrated an area under the curve in the range of 0.80 to 0.94. Sensitivity improved in specimens with optimal cfDNA concentrations. Serial plasma genotyping of EGFR-mutant lung cancer on erlotinib demonstrated pretreatment detection of EGFR mutations, complete plasma response in most cases, and increasing levels of EGFR T790M emerging before objective progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive genotyping of cfDNA using ddPCR demonstrates assay qualities that could allow effective translation into a clinical diagnostic. Serial quantification of plasma genotype allows noninvasive assessment of response and resistance, including detection of resistance mutations up to 16 weeks before radiographic progression.

	abstract = {Chromosomal aneuploidy is the major reason why couples opt for prenatal diagnosis. Current methods for definitive diagnosis rely on invasive procedures, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, and are associated with a risk of fetal miscarriage. Fetal DNA has been found in maternal plasma but exists as a minor fraction among a high background of maternal DNA. Hence, quantitative perturbations caused by an aneuploid chromosome in the fetal genome to the overall representation of sequences from that chromosome in maternal plasma would be small. Even with highly precise single molecule counting methods such as digital PCR, a large number of DNA molecules and hence maternal plasma volume would need to be analyzed to achieve the necessary analytical precision. Here we reasoned that instead of using approaches that target specific gene loci, the use of a locus-independent method would greatly increase the number of target molecules from the aneuploid chromosome that could be analyzed within the same fixed volume of plasma. Hence, we used massively parallel genomic sequencing to quantify maternal plasma DNA sequences for the noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal trisomy 21. Twenty-eight first and second trimester maternal plasma samples were tested. All 14 trisomy 21 fetuses and 14 euploid fetuses were correctly identified. Massively parallel plasma DNA sequencing represents a new approach that is potentially applicable to all pregnancies for the noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies.},

	abstract = {Somatic mutations within tumoral DNA can be used as highly specific biomarkers to distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts. These DNA biomarkers are potentially useful for the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and follow-up of patients. In order to have the required sensitivity and specificity to detect rare tumoral DNA in stool, blood, lymph and other patient samples, a simple, sensitive and quantitative procedure to measure the ratio of mutant to wild-type genes is required. However, techniques such as dual probe TaqMan(®) assays and pyrosequencing, while quantitative, cannot detect less than ∼1\% mutant genes in a background of non-mutated DNA from normal cells. Here we describe a procedure allowing the highly sensitive detection of mutated DNA in a quantitative manner within complex mixtures of DNA. The method is based on using a droplet-based microfluidic system to perform digital PCR in millions of picolitre droplets. Genomic DNA (gDNA) is compartmentalized in droplets at a concentration of less than one genome equivalent per droplet together with two TaqMan(®) probes, one specific for the mutant and the other for the wild-type DNA, which generate green and red fluorescent signals, respectively. After thermocycling, the ratio of mutant to wild-type genes is determined by counting the ratio of green to red droplets. We demonstrate the accurate and sensitive quantification of mutated KRAS oncogene in gDNA. The technique enabled the determination of mutant allelic specific imbalance (MASI) in several cancer cell-lines and the precise quantification of a mutated KRAS gene in the presence of a 200,000-fold excess of unmutated KRAS genes. The sensitivity is only limited by the number of droplets analyzed. Furthermore, by one-to-one fusion of drops containing gDNA with any one of seven different types of droplets, each containing a TaqMan(®) probe specific for a different KRAS mutation, or wild-type KRAS, and an optical code, it was possible to screen the six common mutations in KRAS codon 12 in parallel in a single experiment.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we are working toward a problem of great importance to global health: determination of viral HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) loads under point-of-care and resource limited settings. While antiretroviral treatments are becoming widely available, viral load must be evaluated at regular intervals to prevent the spread of drug resistance and requires a quantitative measurement of RNA concentration over a wide dynamic range (from 50 up to 10(6) molecules/mL for HIV and up to 10(8) molecules/mL for HCV). "Digital" single molecule measurements are attractive for quantification, but the dynamic range of such systems is typically limited or requires excessive numbers of compartments. Here we designed and tested two microfluidic rotational SlipChips to perform multivolume digital RT-PCR (MV digital RT-PCR) experiments with large and tunable dynamic range. These designs were characterized using synthetic control RNA and validated with HIV viral RNA and HCV control viral RNA. The first design contained 160 wells of each of four volumes (125 nL, 25 nL, 5 nL, and 1 nL) to achieve a dynamic range of 5.2 × 10(2) to 4.0 × 10(6) molecules/mL at 3-fold resolution. The second design tested the flexibility of this approach, and further expanded it to allow for multiplexing while maintaining a large dynamic range by adding additional wells with volumes of 0.2 nL and 625 nL and dividing the SlipChip into five regions to analyze five samples each at a dynamic range of 1.8 × 10(3) to 1.2 × 10(7) molecules/mL at 3-fold resolution. No evidence of cross-contamination was observed. The multiplexed SlipChip can be used to analyze a single sample at a dynamic range of 1.7 × 10(2) to 2.0 × 10(7) molecules/mL at 3-fold resolution with limit of detection of 40 molecules/mL. HIV viral RNA purified from clinical samples were tested on the SlipChip, and viral load results were self-consistent and in good agreement with results determined using the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test. With further validation, this SlipChip should become useful to precisely quantify viral HIV and HCV RNA for high-performance diagnostics in resource-limited settings. These microfluidic designs should also be valuable for other diagnostic and research applications, including detecting rare cells and rare mutations, prenatal diagnostics, monitoring residual disease, and quantifying copy number variation and gene expression patterns. The theory for the design and analysis of multivolume digital PCR experiments is presented in other work by Kreutz et al.},

The ability of ddPCR to detect and quantitate total HIV-1 DNA and 2-LTR circles from a panel of patients on and off antiviral therapy was evaluated compared to established real-time (RT)-PCR methods. To calculate the dynamic range of ddPCR for HIV-1 DNA and 2-LTR circles, serial dilutions of DNA amplicons or episomes were determined by ddPCR as well as with RT-PCR. HIV-1 DNA from 3 viremic patients and 4 patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, and 2-LTR circles from 3 patients with low-level viremia were also quantitated. Copy numbers determined by ddPCR of serial dilutions of HIV-1 or human CCR5 DNA amplicon standards were comparable to nominal input copy number. The sensitivity of ddPCR to detect HIV-1 or CCR5 DNA was similar to that of RT-PCR. Low levels of 2-LTR circles were detected in samples from all 3 patients by both ddPCR and RT-PCR. ddPCR is a promising novel technology for the study of HIV-1 reservoirs and persistence, but further optimization of this novel technology would enhance the detection of very low-level viral genetic targets.},

Specifically, ultrasound was used to shear lambda genomic DNA into fragments of less than 200 base pairs, followed by deoxyribonuclease Ι and phosphodiesterase Ι digestion and liquid chromatography-isotope dilution mass spectrometry (LC-IDMS) quantification to estimate the mass fraction of the lambda DNA, based on the constituent deoxynucleotide monophosphates (dNMPs) within the molecule. Digital PCR (dPCR) was employed to quantify the same lambda DNA solution to provide independent data for comparing the performance of two quantitative methods. On the basis of the LC-IDMS measurement after ultrasonic treatment of the sample, the concentration of lambda DNA was 273.1 ± 9.8 μg/g (expanded uncertainty at the 95\% confidence interval). This shows good agreement with the data from dPCR. Additionally, the result calculated on the basis of the sum of the concentrations of the four dNMPs is the same as that calculated on the basis of the sequence, which indicates that knowledge of the DNA sequence and length is unnecessary to measure the total DNA concentration when applying ultrasonic treatment-LC-IDMS.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To study the ability of a stabilizing reagent to prevent cellular DNA contamination of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma during whole blood sample storage and shipping.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Samples were drawn from healthy donors into K₃EDTA and Cell-Free DNA BCTs (BCT) and stored at room temperature (RT). Aliquots were removed at specified time points and cfDNA was purified from the plasma. A Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) assay that amplifies a short β-actin gene fragment (136 bp) was used to measure the total plasma cfDNA (pDNA) concentration while a longer β-actin fragment (420 bp) was used to quantify genomic DNA (gDNA). In a follow-up experiment, blood samples drawn into the same types of tubes were shipped round trip by overnight air before cfDNA was isolated and analyzed.
RESULTS: Blood stored in K₃EDTA tubes at RT showed increases in pDNA and gDNA concentrations over time. However, both pDNA and gDNA levels remained stable in BCT for at least seven days. On day 14, there was a 4.5-fold increase in pDNA in BCT as compared to {\textgreater}200-fold increase in K₃EDTA tubes. Likewise, gDNA increased {\textless}2-fold on day 14 in BCT as opposed to a 456-fold increase in K₃EDTA tubes. Similar results were observed after samples were shipped.
CONCLUSIONS: Cell-Free DNA BCTs prevent gDNA contamination that may occur due to nucleated cell disruption during sample storage and shipping. This novel blood collection tube provides a method for obtaining stable cfDNA samples for rare target detection and accurate analysis while mitigating the threat of gDNA contamination.},

This chip is part of a family of integrated fluidic circuits (IFC) and contains a network of fluid lines, NanoFlex™ valves and chambers. NanoFlex™ valves are made of an elastomeric material that deflects under pressure to create a tight seal and are used to regulate the flow of liquids in the IFC. Digital Arrays have enabled a different approach to digital PCR, by partitioning DNA molecules instead of diluting them. Single DNA molecules are randomly distributed into nanoliter volume reaction chambers and then PCR amplified in the presence of a fluorophore-containing probe. Positive fluorescent signal indicates the presence of a DNA molecule in a reaction chamber, while negative chambers are blank. IFC technology enables the delivery of very precise volumes of solutions in a simple, fast procedure, utilizing a minimum of sample and assay reagents. The development of the IFC technology and the Digital Array chip has revolutionized the field of biology, and has been utilized in gene copy number studies, absolute quantitation (molecule counting) of genomic DNA and cDNA, rare mutation detection, and digital haplotyping.},

We have sought to challenge the limits of this technique with regards to quality and quantity of starting material and the depth of sequencing required. We confirm that the technique can be used to interrogate DNA from cell lines, fresh frozen material and FFPE samples to assess copy number variation. We show that as little as 5 ng of DNA is needed to generate a copy number karyogram, and follow this up with data from a series of FFPE biopsies and surgical samples. We have used various levels of sample multiplexing to demonstrate the adjustable resolution of the methodology, depending on the number of samples and available resources. We also demonstrate reproducibility by use of replicate samples and comparison with microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and digital PCR. This technique can be valuable in both the analysis of routine diagnostic samples and in examining large repositories of fixed archival material.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-10-116},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next-generation DNA sequencing on the 454, Solexa, and SOLiD platforms requires absolute calibration of the number of molecules to be sequenced. This requirement has two unfavorable consequences. First, large amounts of sample-typically micrograms-are needed for library preparation, thereby limiting the scope of samples which can be sequenced. For many applications, including metagenomics and the sequencing of ancient, forensic, and clinical samples, the quantity of input DNA can be critically limiting. Second, each library requires a titration sequencing run, thereby increasing the cost and lowering the throughput of sequencing.
RESULTS: We demonstrate the use of digital PCR to accurately quantify 454 and Solexa sequencing libraries, enabling the preparation of sequencing libraries from nanogram quantities of input material while eliminating costly and time-consuming titration runs of the sequencer. We successfully sequenced low-nanogram scale bacterial and mammalian DNA samples on the 454 FLX and Solexa DNA sequencing platforms. This study is the first to definitively demonstrate the successful sequencing of picogram quantities of input DNA on the 454 platform, reducing the sample requirement more than 1000-fold without pre-amplification and the associated bias and reduction in library depth.
CONCLUSION: The digital PCR assay allows absolute quantification of sequencing libraries, eliminates uncertainties associated with the construction and application of standard curves to PCR-based quantification, and with a coefficient of variation close to 10\%, is sufficiently precise to enable direct sequencing without titration runs.},

This review summarizes recent advances that may lead to clinically useful tests with improved sensitivity, reproducibility and throughput.
RECENT FINDINGS: HIV DNA remains the most sensitive measure of residual infection, but its low levels are difficult to differentiate from assay noise by qPCR. Digital PCR has begun to improve the precision of existing real-time assays, but there remains a need to distinguish replication-competent proviruses. Rapid technological progress in single-cell analysis is beginning to offer new approaches, notably CyTOF and microengraving, which could provide vastly more information about the composition of the latent reservoir.
SUMMARY: To investigate and assess therapies directed towards eradication, improved assays that simultaneously offer high sensitivity, precision and information content will be needed.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.gpb.2012.06.002},
	abstract = {The problem of identifying differential activity such as in gene expression is a major defeat in biostatistics and bioinformatics. Equally important, however much less frequently studied, is the question of similar activity from one biological condition to another. The fold-change, or ratio, is usually considered a relevant criterion for stating difference and similarity between measurements. Importantly, no statistical method for concomitant evaluation of similarity and distinctness currently exists for biological applications. Modern microarray, digital PCR (dPCR), and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies frequently provide a means of coefficient of variation estimation for individual measurements. Using fold-change, and by making the assumption that measurements are normally distributed with known variances, we designed a novel statistical test that allows us to detect concomitantly, thus using the same formalism, differentially and similarly expressed genes (http://cds.ihes.fr). Given two sets of gene measurements in different biological conditions, the probabilities of making type I and type II errors in stating that a gene is differentially or similarly expressed from one condition to the other can be calculated. Furthermore, a confidence interval for the fold-change can be delineated. Finally, we demonstrate that the assumption of normality can be relaxed to consider arbitrary distributions numerically. The Concomitant evaluation of Distinctness and Similarity (CDS) statistical test correctly estimates similarities and differences between measurements of gene expression. The implementation, being time and memory efficient, allows the use of the CDS test in high-throughput data analysis such as microarray, dPCR, and NGS experiments. Importantly, the CDS test can be applied to the comparison of single measurements (N=1) provided the variance (or coefficient of variation) of the signals is known, making CDS a valuable tool also in biomedical analysis where typically a single measurement per subject is available.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal plasma mRNA encoded by the PLAC4 gene (placenta-specific 4), which is transcribed from chromosome 21 in placental cells, is a potential marker for the noninvasive assessment of chromosome 21 dosage in the fetus. We evaluated the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of 2 trisomy 21-screening approaches that use maternal plasma PLAC4 mRNA.
METHODS: We studied maternal plasma samples from 153 pregnant women carrying euploid and trisomy 21 fetuses. For the samples in which the fetuses were heterozygous for the studied PLAC4 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), we measured the ratio between 2 alleles of the SNP in maternal plasma PLAC4 mRNA (RNA-SNP) by mass spectrometric (MS) and digital PCR methods. For pregnancies involving fetuses homozygous for the SNP, we quantified the total PLAC4 mRNA concentration in maternal plasma by real-time PCR and digital PCR.
RESULTS: For the RNA-SNP approach, we achieved a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100\% (95\% CI, 40.2\%-100\%) and 89.7\% (95\% CI, 78.8\%-96.1\%), respectively, for both the MS and the digital PCR methods. For the mRNA-quantification approach, the areas under the ROC curves were 0.859 (95\% CI, 0.741-0.903) and 0.833 (95\% CI, 0.770-0.923) for plasma PLAC4 mRNA concentrations measured by the real-time PCR and the digital PCR methods, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: For prenatal screening of trisomy 21, the quantification of the total PLAC4 mRNA concentration can be used in a synergistic manner with the RNA-SNP allelic ratio approach to increase the population coverage of cases in which diagnostic information can be obtained.},

In addition, the review explores the usefulness of these methods in determining the effectiveness of new HIV-1 eradication strategies in purging persistent HIV-1 reservoirs.
RECENT FINDINGS: Quantification of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels remains essential for determining the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in treated patients. Recently, several new platforms with improved sensitivity for quantifying HIV-1 RNA have been developed and the application of these assays has revealed that low-level viremia persists in patients on suppressive therapy. In addition, new technological advances such as digital PCR have been proposed to increase the sensitivity of measuring and characterizing persistent HIV-1 viremia. The application of these assays will be important in determining the effectiveness of future HIV-1 eradication strategies.
SUMMARY: The level of HIV-1 RNA in patient plasma remains an important marker for determining the success of cART. New sensitive assays have found that HIV-1 persists in the plasma of patients on suppressive therapy that may have implications for the clinical management of this disease and strategies for eliminating HIV-1 infection.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis can be achieved by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma. The fact that circulating fetal DNA represents only a minor fraction of the DNA that is present in maternal plasma has presented analytical challenges for a number of applications. In this review, we discuss such challenges and how they have been resolved by recent developments in the field.
RECENT FINDINGS: Digital molecular counting methods, such as digital PCR and massively parallel sequencing, have enabled high quantitative precision for maternal plasma DNA analysis. Noninvasive prenatal analysis of monogenic disease mutations has been achieved by identifying small quantitative differences between the mutant and wild-type alleles in maternal plasma. By measuring the small increment in the fractional concentrations of DNA derived from potentially aneuploid chromosomes in maternal plasma, fetal chromosomal aneuploidies have been detected with high diagnostic accuracies.
SUMMARY: Recently, advances in molecular technologies have enhanced the diagnostic applications of maternal plasma DNA analysis for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. We foresee that this technology could play an increasingly important role in prenatal investigations.},

	abstract = {The term 'field cancerization' is used to describe an epithelial surface that has a propensity to develop cancerous lesions, and in the case of the aerodigestive tract this is often as a result of chronic exposure to carcinogens in cigarette smoke 1, 2. The clinical endpoint is the development of multiple tumours, either simultaneously or sequentially in the same epithelial surface. The mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear; one possible explanation is that the epithelium is colonized by a clonal population of cells that are at increased risk of progression to cancer. We now address this possibility in a short case series, using individual genomic events as molecular biomarkers of clonality. In squamous lung cancer the most common genomic aberration is 3q amplification. We use a digital PCR technique to assess the clonal relationships between multiple biopsies in a longitudinal bronchoscopic study, using amplicon boundaries as markers of clonality. We demonstrate that clonality can readily be defined by these analyses and confirm that field cancerization occurs at a pre-invasive stage and that pre-invasive lesions and subsequent cancers are clonally related. We show that while the amplicon boundaries can be shared between different biopsies, the degree of 3q amplification and the internal structure of the 3q amplicon varies from lesion to lesion. Finally, in this small cohort, the degree of 3q amplification corresponds to clinical progression.},

First, the entire population of mRNAs is encoded with molecular barcodes during reverse transcription. After amplification of the gene targets of interest, molecular barcodes are counted by sequencing or scored on a simple hybridization detector to reveal the number of molecules in the starting sample. Since absolute quantities are measured, calibration to standards is unnecessary, and many of the relative quantitation challenges such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) bias are avoided. We apply the method to gene expression analysis of minute sample quantities and demonstrate precise measurements with sensitivity down to sub single-cell levels. The method is an easy, single-tube, end point assay utilizing standard thermal cyclers and PCR reagents. Accurate and precise measurements are obtained without any need for cycle-to-cycle intensity-based real-time monitoring or physical partitioning into multiple reactions (e.g., digital PCR). Further, since all mRNA molecules are encoded with molecular barcodes, amplification can be used to generate more material for multiple measurements and technical replicates can be carried out on limited samples. The method is particularly useful for small sample quantities, such as single-cell experiments. Digital encoding of cellular content preserves true abundance levels and overcomes distortions introduced by amplification.},

	abstract = {In this paper, digital quantitative detection of nucleic acids was achieved at the single-molecule level by chemical initiation of over one thousand sequence-specific, nanoliter isothermal amplification reactions in parallel. Digital polymerase chain reaction (digital PCR), a method used for quantification of nucleic acids, counts the presence or absence of amplification of individual molecules. However, it still requires temperature cycling, which is undesirable under resource-limited conditions. This makes isothermal methods for nucleic acid amplification, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), more attractive. A microfluidic digital RPA SlipChip is described here for simultaneous initiation of over one thousand nL-scale RPA reactions by adding a chemical initiator to each reaction compartment with a simple slipping step after instrument-free pipet loading. Two designs of the SlipChip, two-step slipping and one-step slipping, were validated using digital RPA. By using the digital RPA SlipChip, false-positive results from preinitiation of the RPA amplification reaction before incubation were eliminated. End point fluorescence readout was used for "yes or no" digital quantification. The performance of digital RPA in a SlipChip was validated by amplifying and counting single molecules of the target nucleic acid, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) genomic DNA. The digital RPA on SlipChip was also tolerant to fluctuations of the incubation temperature (37-42 °C), and its performance was comparable to digital PCR on the same SlipChip design. The digital RPA SlipChip provides a simple method to quantify nucleic acids without requiring thermal cycling or kinetic measurements, with potential applications in diagnostics and environmental monitoring under resource-limited settings. The ability to initiate thousands of chemical reactions in parallel on the nanoliter scale using solvent-resistant glass devices is likely to be useful for a broader range of applications.},

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is currently used for quantitative molecular analysis of the presence of GMOs in products. However, its use is limited for detecting and quantifying very small numbers of DNA targets, as in some complex food and feed matrices. Using ddPCR duplex assay, we have measured the absolute numbers of MON810 transgene and hmg maize reference gene copies in DNA samples. Key performance parameters of the assay were determined. The ddPCR system is shown to offer precise absolute and relative quantification of targets, without the need for calibration curves. The sensitivity (five target DNA copies) of the ddPCR assay compares well with those of individual qPCR assays and of the chamber digital PCR (cdPCR) approach. It offers a dynamic range over four orders of magnitude, greater than that of cdPCR. Moreover, when compared to qPCR, the ddPCR assay showed better repeatability at low target concentrations and a greater tolerance to inhibitors. Finally, ddPCR throughput and cost are advantageous relative to those of qPCR for routine GMO quantification. It is thus concluded that ddPCR technology can be applied for routine quantification of GMOs, or any other domain where quantitative analysis of food and feed samples is needed.},

Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is rapidly replacing real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) as an efficient method of independent DNA quantification. Compared to quantative PCR, ddPCR eliminates the needs for traditional standards; instead, it measures target and reference DNA within the same well. The applications for ddPCR are widespread including targeted quantitation of genetic aberrations, which is commonly achieved with a two-color fluorescent oligonucleotide probe (TaqMan) design. However, the overall cost and need for optimization can be greatly reduced with an alternative method of distinguishing between target and reference products using the nonspecific DNA binding properties of EvaGreen (EG) dye. By manipulating the length of the target and reference amplicons, we can distinguish between their fluorescent signals and quantify each independently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by examining copy number in the proto-oncogene FLT3 and the common V600E point mutation in BRAF. Using a series of well-characterized control samples and cancer cell lines, we confirmed the accuracy of our method in quantifying mutation percentage and integer value copy number changes. As another novel feature, our assay was able to detect a mutation comprising less than 1\% of an otherwise wild-type sample, as well as copy number changes from cancers even in the context of significant dilution with normal DNA. This flexible and cost-effective method of independent DNA quantification proves to be a robust alternative to the commercialized TaqMan assay.},

Roberts et al. adapted droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), an emulsion PCR process that performs absolute quantitation of nucleic acids, to detect and quantify Chlamydia trachomatis infections. They compared the results with ddPCR on conjunctival swab specimens collected in trachoma-endemic area to results using Roche's Amplicor® C. trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae (CT/NG) PCR and found that ddPCR sensitivity was 73.3\%. The authors concluded that 'ddPCR is an effective diagnostic technology suitable for both research and clinical use in diagnosing ocular C. trachomatis infections'. This reviewer disagrees, feeling that if the stated sensitivity is accurate, it is too low, and suggests there may be good reasons to adapt commercially available tests for this purpose.},

However, FFPE cancer genomic DNA is oftentimes degraded and generally a poor substrate for many molecular biology assays. To overcome the issues of poor DNA quality from FFPE samples and detect oncogenic copy number amplifications with high accuracy and sensitivity, we developed a novel approach. Our assay requires nanogram amounts of genomic DNA, thus facilitating study of small amounts of clinical samples. Using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), we can determine the relative copy number of specific genomic loci even in the presence of intermingled normal tissue. We used a control dilution series to determine the limits of detection for the ddPCR assay and report its improved sensitivity on minimal amounts of DNA compared to standard real-time PCR. To develop this approach, we designed an assay for the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene (FGFR2) that is amplified in a gastric and breast cancers as well as others. We successfully utilized ddPCR to ascertain FGFR2 amplifications from FFPE-preserved gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.},

At the moment, cell free DNA is most widely used for the purpose of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal sex or fetal RhD status. The recent discovery of epigenetic changes in placental/fetal DNA and the detection of fetal/placental-specific RNAs have made it possible to use this technology in all pregnancies irrespective of the gender of the fetus. With the application of new techniques such as next generation sequencing, digital PCR and mass spectrometry, it is now possible to detect very small amounts of specific DNA in the presence of excess of other nonspecific nucleic acids. Second most probable application is in oncology, where detection and monitoring of tumors is now possible by the detection of tumor-derived nucleic acids. Third promising field for near future implementation of this analyte is transplantation medicine, where free DNA level could serve as a marker of transplant rejection. Before any further utilization of this new biomarker, pre-analytical and analytical aspects of free DNA analysis remain to be standardized. In the field of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis, important ethical, legal and social questions remain to be discussed.},

	abstract = {The term 'single-molecule genomics' (SMG) describes a group of molecular methods in which single molecules are detected or sequenced. The focus on the analysis of individual molecules distinguishes these techniques from more traditional methods, in which template DNA is cloned or PCR-amplified prior to analysis. Although technically challenging, the analysis of single molecules has the potential to play a major role in the delivery of truly personalized medicine. The two main subgroups of SMG methods are single-molecule digital PCR and single-molecule sequencing. Single-molecule PCR has a number of advantages over competing technologies, including improved detection of rare genetic variants and more precise analysis of copy-number variation, and is more easily adapted to the often small amount of material that is available in clinical samples. Single-molecule sequencing refers to a number of different methods that are mainly still in development but have the potential to make a huge impact on personalized medicine in the future.},

	abstract = {Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) has recently been identified in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), an aggressive cancer that occurs in sun-exposed skin. Conventional technologies, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, have produced conflicting results for MCPyV infections in non-MCC tumors. Therefore, we performed quantitative analyses of the MCPyV copy number in various skin tumor tissues, including MCC (n = 9) and other sun exposure-related skin tumors (basal cell carcinoma [BCC, n = 45], actinic keratosis [AK, n = 52], Bowen's disease [n = 34], seborrheic keratosis [n = 5], primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma [n = 5], malignant melanoma [n = 5], and melanocytic nevus [n = 6]). In a conventional PCR analysis, MCPyV DNA was detected in MCC (9 cases; 100\%), BCC (1 case; 2\%), and AK (3 cases; 6\%). We then used digital PCR technology to estimate the absolute viral copy number per haploid human genome in these tissues. The viral copy number per haploid genome was estimated to be around 1 in most MCC tissues, and there were marked differences between the MCC (0.119-42.8) and AK (0.02-0.07) groups. PCR-positive BCC tissue showed a similar viral load as MCC tissue (0.662). Immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against the MCPyV T antigen (CM2B4) demonstrated positive nuclear localization in most of the high-viral-load tumor groups (8 of 9 MCC and 1 BCC), but not in the low-viral-load or PCR-negative tumor groups. These results demonstrated that MCPyV infection is possibly involved in a minority of sun-exposed skin tumors, including BCC and AK, and that these tumors display different modes of infection.},

	abstract = {The estimated mean copy per partition (λ) is the essential information from a digital PCR (dPCR) experiment because λ can be used to calculate the target concentration in a sample. However, little information is available how to statistically compare dPCR runs of multiple runs or reduplicates. The comparison of λ values from several runs is a multiple comparison problem, which can be solved using the binary structure of dPCR data. We propose and evaluate two novel methods based on Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Multiple Ratio Tests (MRT) for comparison of digital PCR experiments. We enriched our MRT framework with computation of simultaneous confidence intervals suitable for comparing multiple dPCR runs. The evaluation of both statistical methods support that MRT is faster and more robust for dPCR experiments performed in large scale. Our theoretical results were confirmed by the analysis of dPCR measurements of dilution series. Both methods were implemented in the dpcR package (v. 0.2) for the open source R statistical computing environment.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in digital PCR (dPCR) because technological progress makes it a practical and increasingly affordable technology. dPCR allows the precise quantification of nucleic acids, facilitating the measurement of small percentage differences and quantification of rare variants. dPCR may also be more reproducible and less susceptible to inhibition than quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Consequently, dPCR has the potential to have a substantial impact on research as well as diagnostic applications. However, as with qPCR, the ability to perform robust meaningful experiments requires careful design and adequate controls. To assist independent evaluation of experimental data, comprehensive disclosure of all relevant experimental details is required. To facilitate this process we present the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Digital PCR Experiments guidelines. This report addresses known requirements for dPCR that have already been identified during this early stage of its development and commercial implementation. Adoption of these guidelines by the scientific community will help to standardize experimental protocols, maximize efficient utilization of resources, and enhance the impact of this promising new technology.},
